# cbt: toy torrent client in modern C++ (Uncompleted Yet ðŸš§)

The code and the general structure of the program are primarily based on the following blog posts:

- [Building a BitTorrent client from the ground up in Go](https://blog.jse.li/posts/torrent/)
- [A BitTorrent client in Python 3.5](https://markuseliasson.se/article/bittorrent-in-python/)

with reference to this repository:

- [A simple BitTorrent client written in C++](https://github.com/ss16118/torrent-client-cpp)

Please note that this project was created primarily to familiarize me with the C++ language. Therefore, the code may not conform to normal C++ style, and there are undoubtedly many places where the code can be optimized.

## build

To build this project, follow the commands below:

```bash
cmake --preset=default
