# cbt: toy torrent client in modern C++ (Uncompleted Yet ðŸš§)

The code and the general structure of the program are primarily based on the following blog post:

- [A simple BitTorrent client written in C++](https://github.com/ss16118/torrent-client-cpp)
- [Building a BitTorrent client from the ground up in Go](https://blog.jse.li/posts/torrent/)
- [A BitTorrent client in Python 3.5](https://markuseliasson.se/article/bittorrent-in-python/)

Note that this C++ project is started to familiarize myself with the language. Hence, the code might not comply with the normal C++ styles, and there are undoubtedly places where the code can be optimized.

## build

To build this project, follow the commands below:

```bash
cmake --preset=default
cmake --build build
```

Since this is only a project that I started for fun and to learn C++, it is unlikely that any of those features will be implemented any time soon. If you'd like to build on top of my current code, feel free to do so.
